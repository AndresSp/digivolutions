## Digivolutions
The first two animated digivolutions with just html, js, css and svg.

## Visuals

These are the expected results:

**Koromon -> Agumon**

**Agumon -> Greymon**
> ![Agumon](https://github.com/AndresSp/digivolutions/blob/main/examples/agumon.gif)

## RoadMap
- [x] Extract characters from video (8 directions)
- [x] Convert them to SVG
- [ ] Create and animate evolution platform
- [ ] Create and animate letters
- [x] Animate SVG rotations
- [ ] Zoom in/out (At this point I have the first digivolution)
- [ ] Digivice SVG
- [ ] Animate rectangules serie
- [ ] Letters cone
- [ ] Lighting polygon 
- [ ] Explotions (At this point I have the second digivolution)
